FBAutomatedBirthdayResponder
============================

Takes in an acess token and thanks people who've posted Happy Birthday on your wall.

Where do I get the acess token ?
Ideal way is to get it by creating a Facebook App and then getting privilieges. For personal use, I use the graph explorer.

What privileges does it need ?
The "read_feed" and "publish_actions" permissions should do.
